                  <li>It is also responsible for removing the right front wheel once it has been loosened by the technicians.</li>
                  <li>Itâ€™s the one that validates that everything is ok so that the car can get out of the pits.</li>
                </ul>

              <h5>Wheel Technicians (three)</h5>

                  <li>Remove the wheel and replace it with another</li>
                  <li>Secure the new wheel</li>
                </ul>

              <h5>Gas Man (one)</h5>  
              
                <p>He is in charge of filling the fuel tank, the task can begin as soon as the car arrives in the pit.</p>
